# AFApatcher-EU4

Script for removing culture/religion requirements for building/using EU4 monuments from monument txt files. 

Please note that you must have Python installed in order to run the patcher: https://www.python.org/

### To use: 
1) Create a folder to put the patcher file in wherever is convenient for you (mine is on my desktop). 

2) Place the patcher file in the directory and run it once. Two folders should be created called "Files To Patch" and "Old". 

3) Drag all the monument files that you want patched into the "Files To Patch" folder. 

4) Run the patcher file. Depending on how your python is set up you can do this by double clicking the patcher file, opening the console and running with ```$ python "your_path/AFApatcher.py"``` or running it from an IDE.

5) All the patched files will be in the "Files To Patch" folder, and you can find the unedited backups in the "Old" folder. Note that the "Old" folder will wipe each time the patcher is run so make sure to move any essential files out.
